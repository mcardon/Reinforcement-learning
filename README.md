# Reinforcement-learning
Master project for Mathematical and Computational Models for Neurosciences

The goal of this project is to model Morris pool experiment, where a rat has to find an invisible platform (circle) to get out of a pool (with or without square obstacles).
The behaviour of the rat is modeled by a two-layers neuron network, the learning model in reinforcement learning. 

In the example below we can observe the starting point of the rat (red dot), the path taken to the platform, and the directions learned by the rat in the previous experiments (red arrows). We can see that the rat learns to avoid walls and obstacle, and to find its way to the platform.
